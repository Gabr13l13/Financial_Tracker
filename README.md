# README

This is a basic Financial Tracker developed in Ruby on Rails and HTML.

To start it, just insert "rails server" in the terminal and it will open the localhost (port 3000)

It allowed me to learn about Ruby, since this was my first contact with it. Also, this project's frontend is weak because it was not my focus. I'm not very good at developing stuff in a creative way, since I prefer to develop more in a rational way. 

Thanks for reading.
